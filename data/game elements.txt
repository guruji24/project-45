you have to find trainers accross the world, get teaching from them, and then defeat them to get lord cards from them. you can choose only 1 arc in 1
server. you cannot kill the people of your arc.the battle can be only in 2 persons that means it can be only 1v1 but while attacking the castle, multiple 
people can fight at same time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

balance - 
both players have cards which they can use to transform into lords and attack other, all the arcs have lords of the same power level, which balances
the game at both ends.

adaptivity-
as they will try to destroy the castle, it will get difficult for them to even survive near the castle, as the npc army's power level is high and in a high
quantity. but they can still destroy the castle as they can come with their friends and can take half of their arc's army.
